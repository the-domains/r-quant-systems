Trading System. After reviewing the following article, I am 

sure you will agree that we have created something unique.

Let me start out by introducing myself. My name is Dean 

Hoffman. I have been in the commodity business for over 23 

years, the last 17 of which I have spent researching and 

developing specialized commodity trading systems.

In 2001, I created a financial software company dedicated 

to commercial trading systems. One of those systems has 

done so well that the Futures Truth Company, an independent 

trading systems evaluator, has decorated us with their 

prestigious Top Ten Trading Systems of All Time award—not 

once, but twice.

My experience ranges from running my own futures brokerage 

firm at the Chicago Mercantile Exchange to my current 

position as a licensed Commodity Trading Adviser. I am the 

founder and owner of two successful trading companies, DH 

Trading Systems and Hoffman Asset Management. Using my 

proprietary trading systems, I trade around 15 million 

dollars in the futures markets daily.

It is from these many years of experience that I have 

refined the ideas that I am about to share with you.

Trading System Basics

In this section, we are going to explore some of the 

fundamentals of commodity trading. Experienced traders may 

want to skip ahead to the section on Relativity.

Trends

The first basic concept that needs to be understood is 

trends. Trends are the basis of all trading profits. Prices 

must “trend” higher from where a trader bought, or they 

must “trend” lower from where he sold to make a profit. 

Some may argue that they are “counter-trend” traders, but 

even these need a trend in price (no matter how short term) 

to make a profit.

When you think about it, trends can be seen everywhere. 

Temperatures gradually trend from warm to cold as winter 

approaches. The demand for gasoline gradually trends higher 

during the summer driving months. Ground moisture trends 

from moist to dry when a drought approaches, and interest 

rates trend from high to low or low to high over time, and 

so on.

All these events, whether seemingly natural or unnatural, 

can create sustained price trends in the futures market, 

and it is from these trends that we can try to profit. 

Systems like these are often referred to as “trend 

following systems.” Calling them “trend following systems” 

is correct because these systems cannot and do not try to 

predict trends. Instead, they jump on board with the trends 

once they have begun, and there are many empirical studies 

that prove that commodity markets tend to trend well.

The real difference among traders is how they determine the 

beginning and end of a trend. A trader may define the 

starting point of a trend as something as basic as a slight 

change in the direction of a moving average. As an example, 

some traders might use a rising moving average of prices as 

a signal that the market is ready to go even higher. 

Counter-trend traders, on the other hand, might use this 

same indicator as a symbol that the market is overbought 

and getting ready to head lower. Both are potentially 

correct depending on their exits. The real question is how 

we can quantify these trading approaches and code them into 

profitable trading systems.

Position Sizing and Money Management

Along with entry and exit methods, a trader must also have 

an excellent position sizing and money management plan. 

Even if his entry and exit points are 90% accurate, if a 

trader risks it all on every trade, at some point the odds 

are substantially in favor of him losing all his money. By 

the same token, a system that is only accurate 10% of the 

time but has proper money management could do well.

The bottom line is that traders need to know precisely how 

much of their account to put at risk in any given trade. It 

is also necessary to know how many positions to buy or sell 

whenever there is a signal. An expert system should provide 

traders with all this information.

Definition of a System

A system can be defined as a combination of entry and exit 

techniques with a proper money management plan. Some people 

are content to trade one system while others may combine 

many different systems.

Trading Psychology

The final piece of the puzzle is proper trading psychology. 

It does not matter how brilliant a trader’s systems are, if 

he is unable to take the heat during the inevitable 

drawdown periods, he will fail. By the same token, if he 

gets too ecstatic during winning periods, he will also tend 

to fail.

The key is emotional consistency and the ability to stick 

to a system through thick and thin. A trader must have 

complete confidence in his approach. This is where 

extensive (and proper) testing can help. Testing can help 

to build up solid proof that what a trader is doing works 

over the long run.

Summary

In summary, traders need to have an edge. This edge should 

consist of:

1. Proven entry and exit techniques
2. A proven position sizing and money management plan
3. Proper trading psychology

Keep in mind that, although it would be easy to expand each 

one of these three points into a whole book of its own, my 

purpose here is simply to give traders a high-level 

overview.

The Relativity Trading System

Now that we have laid the basic groundwork, let’s get into 

the specifics of the Relativity Trading System.

Relativity is a combination of 5 different trading systems. 

Trading 5 systems simultaneously will give a trader much 

greater diversification than trading only one. All these 

systems are essentially trend followers, yet they also 

incorporate parts that are more inclined toward counter-

trend following. Once again, even this helps add to 

diversification.

These 5 different systems also communicate with one another 

and trade together as one integrated unit. For example, if 

one system has already invested heavily in Japanese Yen, 

the other four systems know not to take any more trades in 

that market. Doing so would not help to diversify but only 

raise the risk in the same trading idea.

The Relativity Trading System uses more than just the 

basics of price direction as its method to generate 

signals. Relativity starts by using sophisticated pattern 

recognition techniques that enable it to more accurately 

identify the best risk-to-reward entry points. It then uses 

a series of different exits to limit risk and lock in 

profits. Many customers find this exit methodology 

pleasing, the reason being that, unlike many other trend 

following systems, the Relativity Trading System tends not 

to give much profit back after a large move in its favor.

Dynamic Portfolio

One unique aspect about the Relativity Trading System is 

its dynamic portfolio logic. Unlike most systems that 

predefine a smaller portfolio to trade, Relativity trades 

almost every commodity market, and it does this while still 

maintaining low minimum account size requirements.

The reason it can do this is that this systems program 

ranks nearly all the markets into percentiles on a daily 

basis. It then narrows its list down to only those few 

markets that have the highest relative trending potential. 

The net result of this practice is that, while not many 

markets may be on its radar at any given time, that small 

list is constantly changing depending on where the best 

opportunities lie, and the greatest benefit is that traders 

do not have to worry that the best trends will occur in 

markets that they do not trade!

Money Management and Position Sizing

The Relativity Trading System also thoroughly handles 

position sizing and money management. It specifically 

manages how many contracts to enter when a trader gets a 

trading signal. This is essential because different futures 

contracts have different volatilities and trading them all 

in equal numbers would not be properly diversifying. If a 

contract, for example, tends to have high-volatility, a 

trader should trade fewer of those than another whose 

volatility is lower. The Relativity Trading System uses a 

trader’s account size to determine the proper position size 

for each trade he makes. Frequently the right position size 

is simply zero, and there are four reasons for this:

First, if the trade occurs in a market that is not strong 

enough in rank to be in the dynamic portfolio. Second, if, 

given the account size, the risk in the trade is just too 

high. Third, if there is already enough or too much risk 

held in that given sector. And fourth, if there is already 

enough or too much risk across all the current positions in 

the portfolio.

Relativity does not try to risk more than 1.5% of a traders 

account size in any given trade. It will also not risk more 

than 5% of his account in any given sector. Let’s suppose, 

for example, that a trader purchases crude oil for his 

account. If the risk in that trade amounts to 5% or more, 

Relativity will not take new trades in any markets that are 

highly correlated such as unleaded gasoline.

Relativity also will not try to risk more than 10% of a 

trader’s entire account at any given time. Meaning, if 

every trade a trader is in were to hit its stop price 

simultaneously, the total should represent no more than 

about 10% of the entire equity of the trader’s account. 

Once the risk level either reaches or goes past this 10% 

level, Relativity will reject all new trades and return a 

position size of zero.
(* see risk disclosure on limiting risk)

Summary

In summary, the Relativity Trading System combines all the 

parts that I believe are essential to a trader becoming 

successful at trading commodities. Relativity diversifies 

not only across many specific winning systems but also 

across nearly every commodity market. This, combined with 

its conservative position sizing and money management, 

creates a system that should not only meet but far exceed 

traders’ expectations.

IMPORTANT RISK DISCLOSURES

*Risk percentages cannot be guaranteed, occasional market 

conditions could cause a traders stop loss orders not to be 

filled at the specified prices

Futures based investments are often complex and can carry 

the risk of substantial losses. They are intended for 

sophisticated investors and are not suitable for everyone. 

The ability to withstand losses and to adhere to a 

particular trading program in spite of trading losses are 

material points which can adversely affect investor 

returns.

Past performance is not necessarily indicative of future 

results.

HYPOTHETICAL PERFORMANCE RESULTS HAVE MANY INHERENT 

LIMITATIONS, SOME OF WHICH ARE DESCRIBED BELOW. NO 

REPRESENTATION IS BEING MADE THAT ANY ACCOUNT WILL OR IS 

LIKELY TO ACHIEVE PROFITS OR LOSSES SIMILAR TO THOSE SHOWN; 

IN FACT, THERE ARE FREQUENTLY SHARP DIFFERENCES BETWEEN 

HYPOTHETICAL PERFORMANCE RESULTS AND THE ACTUAL RESULTS 

SUBSEQUENTLY ACHIEVED BY ANY PARTICULAR TRADING PROGRAM. 

ONE OF THE LIMITATIONS OF HYPOTHETICAL PERFORMANCE RESULTS 

IS THAT THEY ARE GENERALLY PREPARED WITH THE BENEFIT OF 

HINDSIGHT. IN ADDITION, HYPOTHETICAL TRADING DOES NOT 

INVOLVE FINANCIAL RISK, AND NO HYPOTHETICAL TRADING RECORD 

CAN COMPLETELY ACCOUNT FOR THE IMPACT OF FINANCIAL RISK OF 

ACTUAL TRADING. FOR EXAMPLE, THE ABILITY TO WITHSTAND 

LOSSES OR TO ADHERE TO A PARTICULAR TRADING PROGRAM IN 

SPITE OF TRADING LOSSES ARE MATERIAL POINTS WHICH CAN ALSO 

ADVERSELY AFFECT ACTUAL TRADING RESULTS. THERE ARE NUMEROUS 

OTHER FACTORS RELATED TO THE MARKETS IN GENERAL OR TO THE 

IMPLEMENTATION OF ANY SPECIFIC TRADING PROGRAM WHICH CANNOT 

BE FULLY ACCOUNTED FOR IN THE PREPARATION OF HYPOTHETICAL 

PERFORMANCE RESULTS AND ALL WHICH CAN ADVERSELY AFFECT 

TRADING RESULTS.

like to thank you for your interest in the Relativity \n\nTrading System. After reviewing the following article, I am \n\nsure you will agree that we have created something unique.\n\nLet me start out by introducing myself. My name is Dean \n\nHoffman. I have been in the commodity business for over 23 \n\nyears, the last 17 of which I have spent researching and \n\ndeveloping specialized commodity trading systems.\n\nIn 2001, I created a financial software company dedicated \n\nto commercial trading systems. One of those systems has \n\ndone so well that the Futures Truth Company, an independent \n\ntrading systems evaluator, has decorated us with their \n\nprestigious Top Ten Trading Systems of All Time award—not \n\nonce, but twice.\n\nMy experience ranges from running my own futures brokerage \n\nfirm at the Chicago Mercantile Exchange to my current \n\nposition as a licensed Commodity Trading Adviser. I am the \n\nfounder and owner of two successful trading companies, DH \n\nTrading Systems and Hoffman Asset Management. Using my \n\nproprietary trading systems, I trade around 15 million \n\ndollars in the futures markets daily.\n\nIt is from these many years of experience that I have \n\nrefined the ideas that I am about to share with you.\n\nTrading System Basics\n\nIn this section, we are going to explore some of the \n\nfundamentals of commodity trading. Experienced traders may \n\nwant to skip ahead to the section on Relativity.\n\nTrends\n\nThe first basic concept that needs to be understood is \n\ntrends. Trends are the basis of all trading profits. Prices \n\nmust “trend” higher from where a trader bought, or they \n\nmust “trend” lower from where he sold to make a profit. \n\nSome may argue that they are “counter-trend” traders, but \n\neven these need a trend in price (no matter how short term) \n\nto make a profit.\n\nWhen you think about it, trends can be seen everywhere. \n\nTemperatures gradually trend from warm to cold as winter \n\napproaches. The demand for gasoline gradually trends higher \n\nduring the summer driving months. Ground moisture trends \n\nfrom moist to dry when a drought approaches, and interest \n\nrates trend from high to low or low to high over time, and \n\nso on.\n\nAll these events, whether seemingly natural or unnatural, \n\ncan create sustained price trends in the futures market, \n\nand it is from these trends that we can try to profit. \n\nSystems like these are often referred to as “trend \n\nfollowing systems.” Calling them “trend following systems” \n\nis correct because these systems cannot and do not try to \n\npredict trends. Instead, they jump on board with the trends \n\nonce they have begun, and there are many empirical studies \n\nthat prove that commodity markets tend to trend well.\n\nThe real difference among traders is how they determine the \n\nbeginning and end of a trend. A trader may define the \n\nstarting point of a trend as something as basic as a slight \n\nchange in the direction of a moving average. As an example, \n\nsome traders might use a rising moving average of prices as \n\na signal that the market is ready to go even higher. \n\nCounter-trend traders, on the other hand, might use this \n\nsame indicator as a symbol that the market is overbought \n\nand getting ready to head lower. Both are potentially \n\ncorrect depending on their exits. The real question is how \n\nwe can quantify these trading approaches and code them into \n\nprofitable trading systems.\n\nPosition Sizing and Money Management\n\nAlong with entry and exit methods, a trader must also have \n\nan excellent position sizing and money management plan. \n\nEven if his entry and exit points are 90% accurate, if a \n\ntrader risks it all on every trade, at some point the odds \n\nare substantially in favor of him losing all his money. By \n\nthe same token, a system that is only accurate 10% of the \n\ntime but has proper money management could do well.\n\nThe bottom line is that traders need to know precisely how \n\nmuch of their account to put at risk in any given trade. It \n\nis also necessary to know how many positions to buy or sell \n\nwhenever there is a signal. An expert system should provide \n\ntraders with all this information.\n\nDefinition of a System\n\nA system can be defined as a combination of entry and exit \n\ntechniques with a proper money management plan. Some people \n\nare content to trade one system while others may combine \n\nmany different systems.\n\nTrading Psychology\n\nThe final piece of the puzzle is proper trading psychology. \n\nIt does not matter how brilliant a trader’s systems are, if \n\nhe is unable to take the heat during the inevitable \n\ndrawdown periods, he will fail. By the same token, if he \n\ngets too ecstatic during winning periods, he will also tend \n\nto fail.\n\nThe key is emotional consistency and the ability to stick \n\nto a system through thick and thin. A trader must have \n\ncomplete confidence in his approach. This is where \n\nextensive (and proper) testing can help. Testing can help \n\nto build up solid proof that what a trader is doing works \n\nover the long run.\n\nSummary\n\nIn summary, traders need to have an edge. This edge should \n\nconsist of:\n\n1. Proven entry and exit techniques\n2. A proven position sizing and money management plan\n3. Proper trading psychology\n\nKeep in mind that, although it would be easy to expand each \n\none of these three points into a whole book of its own, my \n\npurpose here is simply to give traders a high-level \n\noverview.\n\nThe Relativity Trading System\n\nNow that we have laid the basic groundwork, let’s get into \n\nthe specifics of the Relativity Trading System.\n\nRelativity is a combination of 5 different trading systems. \n\nTrading 5 systems simultaneously will give a trader much \n\ngreater diversification than trading only one. All these \n\nsystems are essentially trend followers, yet they also \n\nincorporate parts that are more inclined toward counter-\n\ntrend following. Once again, even this helps add to \n\ndiversification.\n\nThese 5 different systems also communicate with one another \n\nand trade together as one integrated unit. For example, if \n\none system has already invested heavily in Japanese Yen, \n\nthe other four systems know not to take any more trades in \n\nthat market. Doing so would not help to diversify but only \n\nraise the risk in the same trading idea.\n\nThe Relativity Trading System uses more than just the \n\nbasics of price direction as its method to generate \n\nsignals. Relativity starts by using sophisticated pattern \n\nrecognition techniques that enable it to more accurately \n\nidentify the best risk-to-reward entry points. It then uses \n\na series of different exits to limit risk and lock in \n\nprofits. Many customers find this exit methodology \n\npleasing, the reason being that, unlike many other trend \n\nfollowing systems, the Relativity Trading System tends not \n\nto give much profit back after a large move in its favor.\n\nDynamic Portfolio\n\nOne unique aspect about the Relativity Trading System is \n\nits dynamic portfolio logic. Unlike most systems that \n\npredefine a smaller portfolio to trade, Relativity trades \n\nalmost every commodity market, and it does this while still \n\nmaintaining low minimum account size requirements.\n\nThe reason it can do this is that this systems program \n\nranks nearly all the markets into percentiles on a daily \n\nbasis. It then narrows its list down to only those few \n\nmarkets that have the highest relative trending potential. \n\nThe net result of this practice is that, while not many \n\nmarkets may be on its radar at any given time, that small \n\nlist is constantly changing depending on where the best \n\nopportunities lie, and the greatest benefit is that traders \n\ndo not have to worry that the best trends will occur in \n\nmarkets that they do not trade!\n\nMoney Management and Position Sizing\n\nThe Relativity Trading System also thoroughly handles \n\nposition sizing and money management. It specifically \n\nmanages how many contracts to enter when a trader gets a \n\ntrading signal. This is essential because different futures \n\ncontracts have different volatilities and trading them all \n\nin equal numbers would not be properly diversifying. If a \n\ncontract, for example, tends to have high-volatility, a \n\ntrader should trade fewer of those than another whose \n\nvolatility is lower. The Relativity Trading System uses a \n\ntrader’s account size to determine the proper position size \n\nfor each trade he makes. Frequently the right position size \n\nis simply zero, and there are four reasons for this:\n\nFirst, if the trade occurs in a market that is not strong \n\nenough in rank to be in the dynamic portfolio. Second, if, \n\ngiven the account size, the risk in the trade is just too \n\nhigh. Third, if there is already enough or too much risk \n\nheld in that given sector. And fourth, if there is already \n\nenough or too much risk across all the current positions in \n\nthe portfolio.\n\nRelativity does not try to risk more than 1.5% of a traders \n\naccount size in any given trade. It will also not risk more \n\nthan 5% of his account in any given sector. Let’s suppose, \n\nfor example, that a trader purchases crude oil for his \n\naccount. If the risk in that trade amounts to 5% or more, \n\nRelativity will not take new trades in any markets that are \n\nhighly correlated such as unleaded gasoline.\n\nRelativity also will not try to risk more than 10% of a \n\ntrader’s entire account at any given time. Meaning, if \n\nevery trade a trader is in were to hit its stop price \n\nsimultaneously, the total should represent no more than \n\nabout 10% of the entire equity of the trader’s account. \n\nOnce the risk level either reaches or goes past this 10% \n\nlevel, Relativity will reject all new trades and return a \n\nposition size of zero.\n(* see risk disclosure on limiting risk)\n\nSummary\n\nIn summary, the Relativity Trading System combines all the \n\nparts that I believe are essential to a trader becoming \n\nsuccessful at trading commodities. Relativity diversifies \n\nnot only across many specific winning systems but also \n\nacross nearly every commodity market. This, combined with \n\nits conservative position sizing and money management, \n\ncreates a system that should not only meet but far exceed \n\ntraders’ expectations.\n\nIMPORTANT RISK DISCLOSURES\n\n*Risk percentages cannot be guaranteed, occasional market \n\nconditions could cause a traders stop loss orders not to be \n\nfilled at the specified prices\n\nFutures based investments are often complex and can carry \n\nthe risk of substantial losses. They are intended for \n\nsophisticated investors and are not suitable for everyone. \n\nThe ability to withstand losses and to adhere to a \n\nparticular trading program in spite of trading losses are \n\nmaterial points which can adversely affect investor \n\nreturns.\n\nPast performance is not necessarily indicative of future \n\nresults.\n\nHYPOTHETICAL PERFORMANCE RESULTS HAVE MANY INHERENT \n\nLIMITATIONS, SOME OF WHICH ARE DESCRIBED BELOW. NO \n\nREPRESENTATION IS BEING MADE THAT ANY ACCOUNT WILL OR IS \n\nLIKELY TO ACHIEVE PROFITS OR LOSSES SIMILAR TO THOSE SHOWN; \n\nIN FACT, THERE ARE FREQUENTLY SHARP DIFFERENCES BETWEEN \n\nHYPOTHETICAL PERFORMANCE RESULTS AND THE ACTUAL RESULTS \n\nSUBSEQUENTLY ACHIEVED BY ANY PARTICULAR TRADING PROGRAM. \n\nONE OF THE LIMITATIONS OF HYPOTHETICAL PERFORMANCE RESULTS \n\nIS THAT THEY ARE GENERALLY PREPARED WITH THE BENEFIT OF \n\nHINDSIGHT. IN ADDITION, HYPOTHETICAL TRADING DOES NOT \n\nINVOLVE FINANCIAL RISK, AND NO HYPOTHETICAL TRADING RECORD \n\nCAN COMPLETELY ACCOUNT FOR THE IMPACT OF FINANCIAL RISK OF \n\nACTUAL TRADING. FOR EXAMPLE, THE ABILITY TO WITHSTAND \n\nLOSSES OR TO ADHERE TO A PARTICULAR TRADING PROGRAM IN \n\nSPITE OF TRADING LOSSES ARE MATERIAL POINTS WHICH CAN ALSO \n\nADVERSELY AFFECT ACTUAL TRADING RESULTS. THERE ARE NUMEROUS \n\nOTHER FACTORS RELATED TO THE MARKETS IN GENERAL OR TO THE \n\nIMPLEMENTATION OF ANY SPECIFIC TRADING PROGRAM WHICH CANNOT \n\nBE FULLY ACCOUNTED FOR IN THE PREPARATION OF HYPOTHETICAL \n\nPERFORMANCE RESULTS AND ALL WHICH CAN ADVERSELY AFFECT \n\nTRADING RESULTS.\n</p>","src":null,"created_at":"2015-11-07T23:31:49.141Z","updated_at":null,"metadata":{"isBasedOnUrl":null,"inLanguage":null,"starred":true,"inFeed":true,"hasPage":false,"inNav":false,"keywords":[]},"text":"I’d like to thank you for your interest in the Relativity \n\nTrading System.

Second, if, \n\ngiven the account size, the risk in the trade is just too \n\nhigh. Third, if there is already enough or too much risk \n\nheld in that given sector. And fourth, if there is already \n\nenough or too much risk across all the current positions in \n\nthe portfolio.\n\nRelativity does not try to risk more than 1.5% of a traders \n\naccount size in any given trade. It will also not risk more \n\nthan 5% of his account in any given sector. Let’s suppose, \n\nfor example, that a trader purchases crude oil for his \n\naccount. If the risk in that trade amounts to 5% or more, \n\nRelativity will not take new trades in any markets that are \n\nhighly correlated such as unleaded gasoline.\n\nRelativity also will not try to risk more than 10% of a \n\ntrader’s entire account at any given time. Meaning, if \n\nevery trade a trader is in were to hit its stop price \n\nsimultaneously, the total should represent no more than \n\nabout 10% of the entire equity of the trader’s account. \n\nOnce the risk level either reaches or goes past this 10% \n\nlevel, Relativity will reject all new trades and return a \n\nposition size of zero.\n(* see risk disclosure on limiting risk)\n\nSummary\n\nIn summary, the Relativity Trading System combines all the \n\nparts that I believe are essential to a trader becoming \n\nsuccessful at trading commodities. Relativity diversifies \n\nnot only across many specific winning systems but also \n\nacross nearly every commodity market. This, combined with \n\nits conservative position sizing and money management, \n\ncreates a system that should not only meet but far exceed \n\ntraders’ expectations.\n\nIMPORTANT RISK DISCLOSURES\n\n*Risk percentages cannot be guaranteed, occasional market \n\nconditions could cause a traders stop loss orders not to be \n\nfilled at the specified prices\n\nFutures based investments are often complex and can carry \n\nthe risk of substantial losses. They are intended for \n\nsophisticated investors and are not suitable for everyone. \n\nThe ability to withstand losses and to adhere to a \n\nparticular trading program in spite of trading losses are \n\nmaterial points which can adversely affect investor \n\nreturns.\n\nPast performance is not necessarily indicative of future \n\nresults.\n\nHYPOTHETICAL PERFORMANCE RESULTS HAVE MANY INHERENT \n\nLIMITATIONS, SOME OF WHICH ARE DESCRIBED BELOW. NO \n\nREPRESENTATION IS BEING MADE THAT ANY ACCOUNT WILL OR IS \n\nLIKELY TO ACHIEVE PROFITS OR LOSSES SIMILAR TO THOSE SHOWN; \n\nIN FACT, THERE ARE FREQUENTLY SHARP DIFFERENCES BETWEEN \n\nHYPOTHETICAL PERFORMANCE RESULTS AND THE ACTUAL RESULTS \n\nSUBSEQUENTLY ACHIEVED BY ANY PARTICULAR TRADING PROGRAM. \n\nONE OF THE LIMITATIONS OF HYPOTHETICAL PERFORMANCE RESULTS \n\nIS THAT THEY ARE GENERALLY PREPARED WITH THE BENEFIT OF \n\nHINDSIGHT. IN ADDITION, HYPOTHETICAL TRADING DOES NOT \n\nINVOLVE FINANCIAL RISK, AND NO HYPOTHETICAL TRADING RECORD \n\nCAN COMPLETELY ACCOUNT FOR THE IMPACT OF FINANCIAL RISK OF \n\nACTUAL TRADING. FOR EXAMPLE, THE ABILITY TO WITHSTAND \n\nLOSSES OR TO ADHERE TO A PARTICULAR TRADING PROGRAM IN \n\nSPITE OF TRADING LOSSES ARE MATERIAL POINTS WHICH CAN ALSO \n\nADVERSELY AFFECT ACTUAL TRADING RESULTS. THERE ARE NUMEROUS \n\nOTHER FACTORS RELATED TO THE MARKETS IN GENERAL OR TO THE \n\nIMPLEMENTATION OF ANY SPECIFIC TRADING PROGRAM WHICH CANNOT \n\nBE FULLY ACCOUNTED FOR IN THE PREPARATION OF HYPOTHETICAL \n\nPERFORMANCE RESULTS AND ALL WHICH CAN ADVERSELY AFFECT \n\nTRADING RESULTS.\n"}]},"site-footer-item":{"id":"site-footer-item","index":3,"metadata":{"@type":"footer","starred":true},"content":[{"id":"site-footer-block","type":"footer","html":"","metadata":{"starred":true},"footer":{"rss":{"href":"rss.xml","rel":"alternate","title":"R
