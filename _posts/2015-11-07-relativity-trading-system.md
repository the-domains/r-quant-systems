I'd like to thank you for your interest in the Relativity 
Trading System. After reviewing the following article, I am 
sure you will agree that we have created something unique.
Let me start out by introducing myself. My name is Dean 
Hoffman. I have been in the commodity business for over 23 
years, the last 17 of which I have spent researching and 
developing specialized commodity trading systems.
In 2001, I created a financial software company dedicated 
to commercial trading systems. One of those systems has 
done so well that the Futures Truth Company, an independent 
trading systems evaluator, has decorated us with their 
prestigious Top Ten Trading Systems of All Time award---not 
once, but twice.
My experience ranges from running my own futures brokerage 
firm at the Chicago Mercantile Exchange to my current 
position as a licensed Commodity Trading Adviser. I am the 
founder and owner of two successful trading companies, DH 
Trading Systems and Hoffman Asset Management. Using my 
proprietary trading systems, I trade around 15 million 
dollars in the futures markets daily.
It is from these many years of experience that I have 
refined the ideas that I am about to share with you.
Trading System Basics
In this section, we are going to explore some of the 
fundamentals of commodity trading. Experienced traders may 
want to skip ahead to the section on Relativity.
Trends
The first basic concept that needs to be understood is 
trends. Trends are the basis of all trading profits. Prices 
must "trend" higher from where a trader bought, or they 
must "trend" lower from where he sold to make a profit. 
Some may argue that they are "counter-trend" traders, but 
even these need a trend in price (no matter how short term) 
to make a profit.
When you think about it, trends can be seen everywhere. 
Temperatures gradually trend from warm to cold as winter 
approaches. The demand for gasoline gradually trends higher 
during the summer driving months. Ground moisture trends 
from moist to dry when a drought approaches, and interest 
rates trend from high to low or low to high over time, and 
so on.
All these events, whether seemingly natural or unnatural, 
can create sustained price trends in the futures market, 
and it is from these trends that we can try to profit. 
Systems like these are often referred to as "trend 
following systems." Calling them "trend following systems" 
is correct because these systems cannot and do not try to 
predict trends. Instead, they jump on board with the trends 
once they have begun, and there are many empirical studies 
that prove that commodity markets tend to trend well.
The real difference among traders is how they determine the 
beginning and end of a trend. A trader may define the 
starting point of a trend as something as basic as a slight 
change in the direction of a moving average. As an example, 
some traders might use a rising moving average of prices as 
a signal that the market is ready to go even higher. 
Counter-trend traders, on the other hand, might use this 
same indicator as a symbol that the market is overbought 
and getting ready to head lower. Both are potentially 
correct depending on their exits. The real question is how 
we can quantify these trading approaches and code them into 
profitable trading systems.
Position Sizing and Money Management
Along with entry and exit methods, a trader must also have 
an excellent position sizing and money management plan. 
Even if his entry and exit points are 90% accurate, if a 
trader risks it all on every trade, at some point the odds 
are substantially in favor of him losing all his money. By 
the same token, a system that is only accurate 10% of the 
time but has proper money management could do well.
The bottom line is that traders need to know precisely how 
much of their account to put at risk in any given trade. It 
is also necessary to know how many positions to buy or sell 
whenever there is a signal. An expert system should provide 
traders with all this information.
Definition of a System
A system can be defined as a combination of entry and exit 
techniques with a proper money management plan. Some people 
are content to trade one system while others may combine 
many different systems.
Trading Psychology
The final piece of the puzzle is proper trading psychology. 
It does not matter how brilliant a trader's systems are, if 
he is unable to take the heat during the inevitable 
drawdown periods, he will fail. By the same token, if he 
gets too ecstatic during winning periods, he will also tend 
to fail.
The key is emotional consistency and the ability to stick 
to a system through thick and thin. A trader must have 
complete confidence in his approach. This is where 
extensive (and proper) testing can help. Testing can help 
to build up solid proof that what a trader is doing works 
over the long run.
Summary
In summary, traders need to have an edge. This edge should 
consist of:
1\. Proven entry and exit techniques
2\. A proven position sizing and money management plan
3\. Proper trading psychology
Keep in mind that, although it would be easy to expand each 
one of these three points into a whole book of its own, my 
purpose here is simply to give traders a high-level 
overview.
The Relativity Trading System
Now that we have laid the basic groundwork, let's get into 
the specifics of the Relativity Trading System.
Relativity is a combination of 5 different trading systems. 
Trading 5 systems simultaneously will give a trader much 
greater diversification than trading only one. All these 
systems are essentially trend followers, yet they also 
incorporate parts that are more inclined toward counter-
trend following. Once again, even this helps add to 
diversification.
These 5 different systems also communicate with one another 
and trade together as one integrated unit. For example, if 
one system has already invested heavily in Japanese Yen, 
the other four systems know not to take any more trades in 
that market. Doing so would not help to diversify but only 
raise the risk in the same trading idea.
The Relativity Trading System uses more than just the 
basics of price direction as its method to generate 
signals. Relativity starts by using sophisticated pattern 
recognition techniques that enable it to more accurately 
identify the best risk-to-reward entry points. It then uses 
a series of different exits to limit risk and lock in 
profits. Many customers find this exit methodology 
pleasing, the reason being that, unlike many other trend 
following systems, the Relativity Trading System tends not 
to give much profit back after a large move in its favor.
Dynamic Portfolio
One unique aspect about the Relativity Trading System is 
its dynamic portfolio logic. Unlike most systems that 
predefine a smaller portfolio to trade, Relativity trades 
almost every commodity market, and it does this while still 
maintaining low minimum account size requirements.
The reason it can do this is that this systems program 
ranks nearly all the markets into percentiles on a daily 
basis. It then narrows its list down to only those few 
markets that have the highest relative trending potential. 
The net result of this practice is that, while not many 
markets may be on its radar at any given time, that small 
list is constantly changing depending on where the best 
opportunities lie, and the greatest benefit is that traders 
do not have to worry that the best trends will occur in 
markets that they do not trade!
Money Management and Position Sizing
The Relativity Trading System also thoroughly handles 
position sizing and money management. It specifically 
manages how many contracts to enter when a trader gets a 
trading signal. This is essential because different futures 
contracts have different volatilities and trading them all 
in equal numbers would not be properly diversifying. If a 
contract, for example, tends to have high-volatility, a 
trader should trade fewer of those than another whose 
volatility is lower. The Relativity Trading System uses a 
trader's account size to determine the proper position size 
for each trade he makes. Frequently the right position size 
is simply zero, and there are four reasons for this:
First, if the trade occurs in a market that is not strong 
enough in rank to be in the dynamic portfolio. Second, if, 
given the account size, the risk in the trade is just too 
high. Third, if there is already enough or too much risk 
held in that given sector. And fourth, if there is already 
enough or too much risk across all the current positions in 
the portfolio.
Relativity does not try to risk more than 1.5% of a traders 
account size in any given trade. It will also not risk more 
than 5% of his account in any given sector. Let's suppose, 
for example, that a trader purchases crude oil for his 
account. If the risk in that trade amounts to 5% or more, 
Relativity will not take new trades in any markets that are 
highly correlated such as unleaded gasoline.
Relativity also will not try to risk more than 10% of a 
trader's entire account at any given time. Meaning, if 
every trade a trader is in were to hit its stop price 
simultaneously, the total should represent no more than 
about 10% of the entire equity of the trader's account. 
Once the risk level either reaches or goes past this 10% 
level, Relativity will reject all new trades and return a 
position size of zero.

Summary
In summary, the Relativity Trading System combines all the 
parts that I believe are essential to a trader becoming 
successful at trading commodities. Relativity diversifies 
not only across many specific winning systems but also 
across nearly every commodity market. This, combined with 
its conservative position sizing and money management, 
creates a system that should not only meet but far exceed 
traders' expectations.
IMPORTANT RISK DISCLOSURES
\*Risk percentages cannot be guaranteed, occasional market 
conditions could cause a traders stop loss orders not to be 
filled at the specified prices
Futures based investments are often complex and can carry 
the risk of substantial losses. They are intended for 
sophisticated investors and are not suitable for everyone. 
The ability to withstand losses and to adhere to a 
particular trading program in spite of trading losses are 
material points which can adversely affect investor 
returns.
Past performance is not necessarily indicative of future 
results.
HYPOTHETICAL PERFORMANCE RESULTS HAVE MANY INHERENT 
LIMITATIONS, SOME OF WHICH ARE DESCRIBED BELOW. NO 
REPRESENTATION IS BEING MADE THAT ANY ACCOUNT WILL OR IS 
LIKELY TO ACHIEVE PROFITS OR LOSSES SIMILAR TO THOSE SHOWN; 
IN FACT, THERE ARE FREQUENTLY SHARP DIFFERENCES BETWEEN 
HYPOTHETICAL PERFORMANCE RESULTS AND THE ACTUAL RESULTS 
SUBSEQUENTLY ACHIEVED BY ANY PARTICULAR TRADING PROGRAM. 
ONE OF THE LIMITATIONS OF HYPOTHETICAL PERFORMANCE RESULTS 
IS THAT THEY ARE GENERALLY PREPARED WITH THE BENEFIT OF 
HINDSIGHT. IN ADDITION, HYPOTHETICAL TRADING DOES NOT 
INVOLVE FINANCIAL RISK, AND NO HYPOTHETICAL TRADING RECORD 
CAN COMPLETELY ACCOUNT FOR THE IMPACT OF FINANCIAL RISK OF 
ACTUAL TRADING. FOR EXAMPLE, THE ABILITY TO WITHSTAND 
LOSSES OR TO ADHERE TO A PARTICULAR TRADING PROGRAM IN 
SPITE OF TRADING LOSSES ARE MATERIAL POINTS WHICH CAN ALSO 
ADVERSELY AFFECT ACTUAL TRADING RESULTS. THERE ARE NUMEROUS 
OTHER FACTORS RELATED TO THE MARKETS IN GENERAL OR TO THE 
IMPLEMENTATION OF ANY SPECIFIC TRADING PROGRAM WHICH CANNOT 
BE FULLY ACCOUNTED FOR IN THE PREPARATION OF HYPOTHETICAL 
PERFORMANCE RESULTS AND ALL WHICH CAN ADVERSELY AFFECT 
TRADING RESULTS.
